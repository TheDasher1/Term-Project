if there exists some file 'B.png', windows won't let me rename another file 'b.png' because it's considered the same name

Black pieces are named in capital to represent the piece they are but have a 'b' in front to show they are black

white pieces have a 'w' followed by the first letter of the piece they are ('wK.png' represents the white king)
